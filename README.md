# The Hyperverse
The future of the web: a decentralized, VR universe built on top of web technologies. 

Or to put it another way: **a free and open metaverse**.

## What?
The Hyperverse would be a VR layer on top of today's web that you can explore using a new kind of web browser that allows you to navigate 3D spaces loaded from web servers.

Instead of visiting web *pages*, you'd visit web *places*: 3D, VR environments built on top of web technologies.

## Why?
A major win for the web was that it was decentralized. Sure it was janky, but no one person or company owned it. The data was distributed throughout the network and fetched from servers that followed a standard protocol.

The metaverse should be the same way.

## How?
Web developers would use a new, Hyperverse Markup Language (HVML) to describe VR environments made up of interactable **objects** including images, videos, music, web pages and links to other web places. Each of these can be picked up,  moved around, placed, stretched or interacted with.

A lot of the technology necessary is already in place on the web, we just need a new type of content, `text/hvml`, to describe VR environments and an expanded browser that can render them.

The **hyperlink**, the web's most powerful metaphor democratizes the web and ensures no one power owns it. In the hyperverse you'd be able to link to any kind of content and interact with it in VR.

If a link points to another web place, it will appear as a portal into that new place that you can walk through to visit that web place.
